# Olympic-Medal-Prediction

# Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict Olympic medal winners based on historical data and various features related to each participating country. The main objective is to build a predictive model that can forecast the countries likely to win medals in future Olympic games.

The project is implemented using a Jupyter Notebook [Olympic_Medal_Prediction](https://github.com/angle17kavya/Olympic-Medal-Prediction/blob/main/MLProject.ipynb).

# Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

A Google account for accessing Google Colab.<br/>
Basic knowledge of machine learning and Python.<br/>
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitishsharma01/olympics-124-years-datasettill-2020 . It contains historical data about Olympic events, countries, and medal winners. Make sure to download the dataset and upload it to your Google Colab environment or provide the link directly in the notebook.

# Getting Started
Open the [Olympic_Medal_Prediction](https://github.com/angle17kavya/Olympic-Medal-Prediction/blob/main/MLProject.ipynb) notebook in [Google colab](https://colab.google/).<br/>
Make sure the dataset is available and loaded into the notebook.<br/>
Run the notebook cells in sequential order.<br/>
# Usage
The notebook contains detailed explanations and comments for each code block, making it easy to understand the workflow. You can perform the following tasks:

Data preprocessing and cleaning.<br/>
Exploratory data analysis.<br/>
Feature engineering.<br/>
Model selection and training.<br/>
Model evaluation and prediction.<br/>
Feel free to customize the notebook to suit your specific requirements and explore different machine learning models and techniques.<br/>
